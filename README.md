# WelcomeLite

Thanks for taking the time to review my project.
WelcomeLite is a basic django CRUD app that manages a user's job_offers.
A user can Create, Read, Update, and Delete as many job_offers as they desire.
The home screen is a list of their created job_offers.

This project utilizes allauth to handle user creation and authorization.
This project utilizes django-cripsy-forms to have simple and improved forms.
